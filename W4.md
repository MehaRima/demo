“There was a certain freedom that came from evading the baggage of tradition and history,” says Nav Haq in his introduction to Rave and Its Influence on Art and Culture. “Ultimately, this unbridled creativity is what brought out the energetic feeling of rave.”

Feelings of freedom from precedents and “unbridled creativity” are some of the most powerful ingredients for groundbreaking graphic design. Rave culture brought about an almost universal graphic language, which in the decades since its first incarnation has become inextricably bound to its origins, yet transcendent of them.

Rave posters of the 1980s and 90s demonstrated a joyful disregard for convention as did anti-design tropes for punk in previous decades. Type was brash and bold, colors a retina-burning neon, and imagery—like the sounds and samples pervading the scene—delinquently cut and pasted together. These original designs served a purpose that’s become all but redundant in today’s world of online promotion: telling people the wheres, whens, and hows of the party. Palettes were bright to reflect their revellers; type was large enough to be read in a chemical daze.

Commercial director of branding consultancy Bugler Smith Paul Gosling (no relation to me) has worked with numerous dance music clients in the past, and founded the site Crazy Animal Face, which looks at links between design and illustration and music. Today, he says, artists and clubs aren’t so much looking for posters, but for shareable digital content.

“When you see posters today, they’re created as collectible gig memorabilia. When you walk through the streets and see them, they’re really just reaffirming what you’ve already been emailed by promoters or ticketing sites. The whole rave sound is very prevalent right now, but there’s a whole generation that doesn’t know it was a thing before. We still have that poster art, but it’s more of a thing that you could download and use as a phone background.”
